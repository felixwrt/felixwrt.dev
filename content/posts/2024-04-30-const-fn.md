- i've been playing with `const fn` recently and kept wondering when they are executed
- in this post, i'm going to take a look at this topic.

- first some background on regular fns and const fns

## Regular functions
  - are compiled into machine code and executed at runtime
  - can take any type of arguments (const or non-const)
  - cannot be used in constant contexts, e.g. in a constant or as the length of an array
  - example: simple add function can be used with consts, non-consts, but not as a function
```rust
fn square(x: usize) -> usize {
    x * x
}

pub fn main() {
    // called with constants
    const CONST_ARG: usize = 2;
    let res_a = square(CONST_ARG);

    // called with non-consts
    let runtime_arg: usize = std::env::args().len();
    let res_b = square(runtime_arg);
    
    // const RES_CONST: usize = square(5);
    // error: cannot call non-const fn `square` in constants
}
```

## `const fn`
  - can be used in constant contexts AND be compiled/executed like regular functions
  - example: same as above, but show that the function can now be used in a constant
```rust
const fn square(x: usize) -> usize {
    x * x
}

pub fn main() {
    // called with constants
    const CONST_ARG: usize = 2;
    let res_a = square(CONST_ARG);

    // called with non-const arg
    let runtime_arg: usize = std::env::args().len();
    let res_b = square(runtime_arg);
    
    // evaluated at compile-time
    const RES_CONST: usize = square(5);
}
```
  - const functions are kind-of generic over whether they're evaluated at compile time or executed at runtime
  - only a subset of rust can be used inside `const fn` (see https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/const_eval.html)
  - making a function `const fn` is a backwards-compatible change: existing (non-const) uses of the function will continue to work. Additionally, the function can now also be used in constants.
    - many functions in the stdlib are already implemented as `const fn`

- now that we know what `const fn`s are and how they're different from regular functions, we can look into the real question:

## Compile-time or runtime?
  - the compiler guarantees that `const fn` can work in const contexts as well work with non-const data
  - it depends on the individual call-site. The same function can be used in multiple locations, some of which are compile-time evaluated and some of them runtime
  - if any of the arguments isn't const, the function needs to be executed at runtime
```rust
pub fn main() {
    // called with non-const args
    let runtime_arg: usize = std::env::args().len();
    let res_b = square(runtime_arg);
}
```
  - if the function is called from a const context, it needs to be evaluated at compiletime
```rust
pub fn main() {
    const CONST_ARG: usize = 2;
    const RES_CONST: usize = square(CONST_ARG);
}
```
  - const context, non-const args: compiler error
```rust
pub fn main() {
    // called with non-const args
    let runtime_arg: usize = std::env::args().len();
    const RES_CONST: usize = square(runtime_arg);
    // error: attempt to use a non-constant value in a constant
}
```
  - What happens if the function is used in a non-const context, but with const arguments?
```rust
pub fn main() {
    const CONST_ARG: usize = 2;
    let res = square(CONST_ARG);
}
```
    - all inputs are available at compile-time, but the result is only needed at runtime
    - it could be evaluated at compile-time, but could also be executed at runtime
    
- let's try it out!

## Inspecting compiler output
- example: call const fn in the main function and look at the resulting machine code
- using `wrapping_mul` and `std::process::exit` here to make the resulting assembly code easier to read
```rust
const fn square(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x.wrapping_mul(x)
}

pub fn main() {
    std::process::exit(square(10));
}
```
    - function is called at runtime.
    - that's clearly not the most efficient code. Let's try again with optimizations enabled
```asm
example::square:
        mov     eax, edi
        imul    eax, eax
        ret

example::main:
        push    rax
        mov     edi, 10
        call    example::square
        mov     edi, eax
        mov     rax, qword ptr [rip + std::process::exit@GOTPCREL]
        call    rax
```
TODO: show asm (and how to generate it)

- example 2: turn on release mode (`-C opt-level=3`)
    - function is evaluated at compiletime and doesn't even exist in the resulting binary
    - the result (`100`) is directly used in the binary
```asm
example::main:
        push    rax
        mov     edi, 100
        call    qword ptr [rip + std::process::exit@GOTPCREL]
```
TODO: show asm (and how to generate it)

- this looks like the compiler's evaluation of `const fn`s depends on the optimization mode (debug / release)
- let's try the same example with optimizations, but this time using a non-const function:

- example 3: release mode, non-const fn
```asm
example::main:
        push    rax
        mov     edi, 100
        call    qword ptr [rip + std::process::exit@GOTPCREL]
```

- the code is exactly the same as before. Our regular function `square` is evaluated at compile time. What's going on here?


## Constant Propagation
- we're seeing compiler optimizations in action here, most likely function inlining and constant propagation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding)
- Oli: the compiler passes these function calls to llvm -> could be evaluated as part of const prop optimization pass
- it's a general optimization technique that applies to constant data in the program
- for the optimization, it doesn't matter whether we're using const fn or not
- being an optimization though, we can't rely on it being applied (see the debug build)
    - it's likely to work with simple cases
    - probably won't work for more complex functions
    - example: complex const fn that isn't optimized
```rust
const fn fib(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n < 2 {
        return n;
    }
    fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}

pub fn main() {
    std::process::exit(fib(10));
}
```

resulting code: 
```asm
example::main:
        push    rax
        mov     edi, 10
        call    example::fib
        mov     edi, eax
        call    qword ptr [rip + std::process::exit@GOTPCREL]
```

using the same function, but calling it in a const context:

```rust
pub fn main() {
    const RES: i32 = fib(10);
    std::process::exit(RES);
}
```

```asm
example::main:
        push    rax
        mov     edi, 55
        call    qword ptr [rip + std::process::exit@GOTPCREL]
```

    - panics won't be evaluated at compile time  (TODO: should I include this?)
      - example: compile-time eval would break build, even if the code would never have been executed at runtime
    


## Enforcing compile-time evaluation
- what if we want to make sure the function is evaluated at compile-time? A couple of options:
    - assign result to a constant
        - example
    - use a macro that does it (TODO: is this feasible? You'd have to know the type, right?)
        - example
    - const blocks (nightly feature)
        - example
        - TODO: status of the feature

## Summary
- const fns can be evaluated at compile time or executed at compile-time
- compiletime/runtime depends on the arguments and the context in which the function is called
    - table:
        - non-const context && non-const args:  runtime
        -     const context &&     const args: comptime
        -     const context && non-const args: compile error: attempt to use non-constant value in a constant
        - non-const context &&      const args: both possible
            - rustc will not do compile-time evaluation, but llvm's const prop optimizations likely do the compile-time eval
            - doesn't work for things like panics
- to ensure that a fn call is evaluated at compile time, wrap it in a constant or use const-blocks (nightly-feature)
